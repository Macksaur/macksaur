Hello! I am a professional Software Engineer with tonnes of ideas and never enough time to make them all. This is where I write about some of those ideas and share them. My main areas of interest revolve around _Game Development_ and how to write elegant and understandable code. I also like to touch on _Language Design_ from time to time because I am always in search of better ways to express the complex requirements of well written code that includes all the edge-cases and bugfixes!

## Current Project

My current project is a top-down action-adventure RPG. I will write about it soon!
